# Steam Web API Documentation

An automatically generated list of Steam Web API interfaces, methods and parameters. Allows you to craft requests in the browser.

This is a static page that uses Vue.js is automatically generated from
[`GetSupportedAPIList`](https://steamapi.xpaw.me/#ISteamWebAPIUtil/GetSupportedAPIList)
using public and publisher keys, additionally
[a list of undocumented methods is used](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/UndocumentedAPI).  
`generate_api.php` is the script that generates the `api.json` file that is used by the page.

If you specify the web api key, it will be stored in your browser, and will only be sent to Valve's API servers if you chose to do so.

If you know of an API that is not listed here,
[make a pull request to the repository of undocumented APIs](https://github.com/SteamDatabase/UndocumentedAPI).

**âš  Please do not email me about questions on how to use specific APIs,
I provide an automatically updated and generated list, I do not personally know how to use all of them.**
